Requirements
------------
For running merlin with its default configuration, you'll need
to have libdbi-dbd-mysql and all of its dependencies (generally
libdbi-drivers, libdbi and mysql-libs) installed.

You will ofcourse also need an sql database supported by libdbi
(refer to the libdbi documentation for further information about
supported databases), as well as a Nagios installation that the
merlin module can plug in to.

The install script requires administration privileges to create
its installation directories and copy files there, as well as
sql administration privileges in order to create the database
that merlin will populate for you.

GNU sed 4.0.9 or better is required for the install script to
be able to modify your nagios configuration files.


Compilation
-----------
Merlin doesn't support autoconf (and I'm reluctant to take
patches that makes it do so). You'll need to have libdbi-devel
installed. If it's not in a default location, please amend the
CPPFLAGS manually while running make, like so:

     make CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include"


Installation
------------
There is an install-script provided here which will attempt to
make all the necessary modifications to your nagios.cfg file
as well as installing merlin on your system. Please run

  sh install-merlin.sh --dest-dir=/path/to/merlin \
           --nagios-cfg=/path/to/nagios.cfg \
		   --db-type=mysql --db-user=merlin --db-pass=merlin \
		   --db-name=merlin

Note that the install-merlin.sh script requires write access to
whatever directory you choose as --dest-dir, as well as access
to write to your nagios.cfg file.
Also note that the install script can only handle setting up
mysql databases at the moment. Patches welcome to make it also
handle postgresql and whatever else you feel there is a need for.
If a different database type is selected, the install script will
still work, but it will not create the database for you.
